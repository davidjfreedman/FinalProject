Final Project - Affluentsy (in progress)

**Project:** Create something amazing using what you've learned in the class.

**Description:** Taking a cue from an earlier assignment and drawing inspiration from Buzzfeed-style lists of the 'weirdest products on x store', I chose to create Affluentsy.  
The site draws its name inspiration and the data from Etsy's API, culling a list of the most expensive products on the Etsy storefront (the reason being that the most expensive products are often also the weirdest).

On one hand, I tried to emulate the look, feel and functionality of a higher-end online store. Users have the option to curate their experience using categories, search functionality, and result sorting as they would on a normal web-store. However, given the absurdity of many of the products and pricing as a whole, I did try to give a tongue-in-cheek feel in little ways:
  * As on the menu in a fancy dining establishment, the prices are not initially shown. There is a button that allows you to "ask for the price", with the implied suggestion (as in those restaurants) that if you have to ask the price, you probably shouldn't be there.
  * The subtly sarcastic taglines ('Luxury. Quality. Etsy.' and 'Only the finest handmade luxury items').
  * The 'Clearance' section, in which only products under $100k are shown (though not under $10k; we must have standards!), and the accompanying 'sale' banners on these probably preposterously priced products.
  
*The site is dynamically-resizeable for display at most screen-sizes*

**Why?:** I like quirkiness, and I felt that it would be interesting having a site that continually updates with new weird products. I also wanted an opportunity to challenge myself with APIs and replicating real-life storefront look and functionality. 

**Tech Used (as of current version):** jQuery, Javascript, Myth, lodash/underscore templating, FontAwesome, Photoshop, JS Prototypes, Node.js, Etsy API, heroku, HTML, CSS, CSS3.

**Future updates:**
  * Search functionality
  * Category implementation
  * Sorting implementation
  * Fine-tuning the data pulled to present a more curated, 'weirder' list.
  * Infinite scrolling for results (new pages added on scroll to bottom)
  * Backbone integration
  * Path-style implementation to allow for linking to individual listings, the different sections of the website, and sections of results
  * Mobile site functionality improvement.
